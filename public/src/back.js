// The way back: a companion, called Irrlicht (a will-o'-the-wisp: a cold flame that keeps by travellers
// in the dark). In the hub, and once you have gone somewhere (through a portal, into a tag's room, out
// of one, or across the map in one jump), it floats along at your side, off to the left and a little low,
// bobbing as it goes, the way a small machine keeps by someone it looks after. It is not a portal like
// the others: a mouth of dark burnt into the air, its edge burning in a cold blue fire (icefire), giving
// off a thin mist that trails behind it as it moves. It is round, a ball of that dark, its face on one
// side of it: turned away from you, looking at something, you see the back of its head. Through it, you are back where you were before: the dimension, the room
// in it, and where you were a few seconds before you went (not already in the pull of what took you),
// facing as you faced. Taken, it takes you a step further back the next time, as far as it remembers.
// In the hub with nowhere to go back to, it only keeps you company: not a way anywhere, it does not open.
// Right clicked, it takes you to the origin instead (from anywhere but the hub), and again, back.
//
// It follows lazily, and waits where it is while you look at it or come near, so it can be flown into
// (or clicked, as the portals round the clock are: see main.js). Flying into it, its mouth opens wide
// round you and the dark gathers, as at any portal. Its name under the crosshair says where it goes.
//
// In its dark, two eyes, glowing as its edge does. They blink, glance about, and show how it is (see
// MOODS): wide and looking all round when it has just come; calm, glancing now and then; looking back
// at you, pleased, when you look at it; happy, two arches, as you fly into it; narrowed and looking
// ahead when you go fast; wide and anxious when you have left it far behind; drowsy, nodding off, when
// you have kept still a long while; curious, now and then, when calm, turning its face from you a
// while to look at something (a portal, a way out, or only off into the dark) and back; annoyed, half lidded, looking sideways at you and rolling its eyes,
// the longer the more often, when where you are takes a long while to materialize.
//
// While music plays (the player, a radio station, a song in mania: see audio.music), what breaks off its
// edge is music notes instead of embers, rising and swaying, more of them on the beat. Stopped, they
// stop (embers again); played again, they come back a moment after.
//
// Given a name on the start screen, it greets you by it as the flight begins: a few words beside it, in
// its own cold blue, its eyes two happy arches while it says them.
