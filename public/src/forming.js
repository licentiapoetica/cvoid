// place round the clock is not left empty. Out of nothing, slowly, motes of the void's violet are drawn
// in towards where its ring will be, round and round, gathering on the circle; the circle glows faintly
// there, soft light going round it, and the dark of its hole gathers in it like a cloud, thicker the
// longer it waits. Nothing in it flickers or jumps: it all eases. When its own ring is there (not when
// its plugin is: some build their ring only once they have heard from their source), it opens out from
// the middle to meet the motes on the circle, as what stood in for it fades. One that never comes (its
// plugin could not be loaded, or long after it was, still no ring) eases apart instead: its motes drift
// off outwards and fade.
