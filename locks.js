// Locks: a password in front of a plugin, for any of them, and off unless it is set. VVOID_PASSWORD (in
// vvoid's .env) locks every plugin; VVOID_<NAME>_PASSWORD (the plugin's folder name in capitals, - as _)
// is that plugin's own instead, over it (set empty, the plugin is open whatever VVOID_PASSWORD says).
// How long a given password is remembered: VVOID_REMEMBER for all, VVOID_<NAME>_REMEMBER for one, over it
// (30d, 12h, 10m, 90s; a bare number is days). Unset or 0: never, it is asked every time a portal is gone
// through (the session lasts only while you are in its dimensions: the page lets it go as you leave, and
// it is kept nowhere but in memory). Remembered, one right password opens every plugin it is the
// password of (and that remembers), at once, and the session is kept on disk. A locked plugin: everything its
// server answers under /plugins/<name>/ and /api/<name>/ (and its websockets there) then asks for a
// session, and its portal asks for the password (see public/src/locks.js). A page that gives it is given a
// session: a cookie for vvoid's address, for as long as it is remembered from when it was last used, kept on disk by its hash only
// (in .cache/<name>/sessions.json, or VVOID_<NAME>_CACHE), so vvoid restarting does not lock everyone out.
// Open whatever the session: the files in its public/ folder (the page's own code: nothing kept from
// anyone belongs there), the way in itself (/plugins/<name>/lock), and the routes the plugin names as
// open (`unlocked`, in what its server.js returns).
